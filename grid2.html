                Difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox
            </p>
            <li class="card__qoute">
                CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.

To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li class="card__qoute">
                The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.

                To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: flex;

                Benefits of CSS Grid
            </p>
            <li class="card__qoute">
               CSS Grid is very flexible and responsive. It makes it very easy to create  two dimensional lsayouts.CSS Grid is also
               easy to to use and is supported by most web browsers.

            </li>
            <li class="card__qoute">
                The CSS grid makes your markup-up-cleaner in your html code and gives you a lot more flexibility. This is is partly beacuse you
                don't have to change the mark-up (HTML code) to change the position of an item using CSS grid.
 
             </li>
             <li class="card__qoute">
               CSS Grid Layout helps us to build a more complex layouts using both columns and rows.

                When to use CSS Grid?
            </p>
            <li class="card__qoute">
               Although you can use CSS Grid in practically any aspect of the web development there are certain situations when it is ideal.

            </li>
            <li class="card__qoute">
               For example when you have a complex design layout to implement, CSS grid is better than CSS float property.
               This is because  CSS Grid is two-dimensional layout (with columns and rows), whereas CSS float property is one dimensional layout (with columns and rows).
 
             </li>
             <li class="card__qoute">
              Grid is also a good choice when you need a space or gap between elements.
              By using CSS grid "gap" property, the spacing of two elements is mych easier than using
              CSS "margin" and "padding" properties which might end up complicating things.
